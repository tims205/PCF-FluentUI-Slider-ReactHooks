# PCF Fluent UI Slider using React Hooks Example

A very basic example of using [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/slider) and React Hooks as part of a Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) Control to add a slider that controls a whole number value.

This is written as an example to get started with using Fluent UI and React Hooks, there is unlikely to be a real use case simple enough to install this component as-is, but it could be used as a starting point for something else.

Managed and unmanaged solutions can be found in `FluentUISliderReactHooks\Solutions\FluentUISlider\bin`
